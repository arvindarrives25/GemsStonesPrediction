## Diamond Price Prediction
### Introduction About the Data :
```
The dataset The goal is to predict price of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including id):

1. id : unique identifier of each diamond
2. carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.
3. cut : Quality of Diamond Cut
4. color : Color of Diamond
5. clarity : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.
6. depth : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
7. table : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
8. x : Diamond X dimension
9. y : Diamond Y dimension
10. x : Diamond Z dimension

Target variable:

price: Price of the given Diamond.
